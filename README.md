# DjangoTemplate

This template serves as a starting point for Django projects. It includes the necessary configurations and folder structure to quickly get up and running.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

`git clone https://github.com/shawn-carter/DjangoTemplate`

### Step 2: Rename the Folder
You can rename the cloned folder to whatever you like at this point. Use the following commands based on your operating system:

Windows PowerShell:

`move DjangoTemplate NewProject`

Linux:

`mv DjangoTemplate NewProject`

### Step 3: Navigate into the Project Folder

`cd NewProject`

### Step 4: Create a Virtual Environment
Create a new virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated:

`python -m venv venv`

### Step 5: Activate the Virtual Environment

Windows:

`venv\Scripts\activate`
Linux:

`source venv/bin/activate`
